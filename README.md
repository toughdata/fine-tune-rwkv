# Train RWKV for causal language modeling
This script will let you do causal LM RWKV with HuggingFace Transformers library.

## Why?
RWKV is a powerful model, but the tools used to train it are overcomplicated and it is not well-documented.
This script is a simple and *legible* implementation of traingin RWKV using HuggingFace's transformers library.

## Usage
Download the script and run it. 
Just edit the constants right after the if __name__ == "__main__" block if you need to make changes
